TEXTBOOK: Security in Computing, fifth edition. En bombe pÃ¥ forsiden med en safe

Specialist program in Cybersecurity

Prevent -> Detect -> React -> Recover

Primary goals:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
Other goals:
- Accountability
  - Actions can be traced back to a single entity
    People can be made responsible
  - Principle known as non-repudiation in cryptography
- Privacy (privacy families defined by common criteria)
  - Pseudonymity, unlinkability, anonomity, unobservability
  - There is an inherent conflict between accountability and privacy
- Authenticity
  Request or information are authentic and autheticated
  Resourses (both hardware and software)


--Confidentiality--

  - Unauthorised observation of information / resources
  - Secrets remain secrets
  - Military information (important stuff)
  Confidentiality can be ensured with cryptography (encrypt data, cryptographic key)
  Access control mechanism protect data from unauthorised access


--Integrity--

Preventing unauthorised modification of information or resources
  - Origin pertains to the source
The classes of integirty:
  - Prevention mechanism (prevents data being modified in unauthorised ways)
  - Detection mechanism (detected and corrected)

--Availability--

- Systems information and resources are available to authorised users when they need them
- Attacks against availability is known as Denail-of-Service (DoS)
    - Many reports of DoS attacks in the media
- Hardest research

-- Risks --

- Security is concerned with management of risk (elimination or reducing harm to assets)
- Material harm (theft n stuff)
- Immaterial harm (copyright, intellectual property, reputation)
- Risk management (risk identification, treatment, analysis, monitoring / review)

-- Threats --

4 step process
- Threat-> vulneravility -> oppertunity -> attack
- Four major classes of threats
  Disclosure (unauthorised access to information)
  Deception (acceptance of false data)
  Disruption(interruption or prevention of correct operation)
  Unsurpation (unauthorised control of the system)
- Five ways to deal with exploits
  Prevention(remove all vulnerabilites)
  Deterrence(making exploits difficult, but not impoosible)
  Deflection(make other targets relatively more attractive)
  Detection(as they happen or after the fact, forensics)
  Recovery (restore the system to a usable state)

  -- Vulnerabilites --

  Weaknesses in the sucurity architechture
    - Weakness assumtions (security requirements to specified or poorly understood)
    - Weak architechture (security requirements not properly identified, not cover all requirements, not up to date)
    - Weak components (poor specification of components of the security architecthture, implemetation, components do not compose securely)
  Weak operation
    - Poor recruitment processes
    - Poor security awareness


--Possible Attackers--

Over 50% are insiders, employees n stuff (daily access to the network)
Crackers (hackers), often programmers, script-kiddies(cracker wannabes), tools provided by others (have to access internal network, gotta crack that firewall)
Spies (industrial and military) (3 bs, beatings, bribery and blackmail)
Criminals (theives, organized crime) (ability to infiltrate, 3b's)
Terrorists and Hactivitsts
- Consider: means (method,), motives and opportunity


--Motiviation for Attackers--

Curiosuty about how the system works
  The challenge of hacking hte system
  Ethical hacking (expose vulnerabilites and warn others)
Fame (recognition for their achivments)
Finincial gains (fraud, theift, industrial espionage)
Ideology (hactivism, disrupt but do not cause serious damage, cyberterorism)

--Policy--

It is important to distinguish between the policy and the mechanism that enforces the policy
  Policy: statement of what it is, and what is not allowed
  Mechanism: method, tool or process for enforcing a security policy
Security Policies
- Defined in different ways
  Different level of detail from very general to very specific
  Different level of accuracy
When multiple organizations collaborate the composed entity often has a security policy based on the individual security policies


-- Goals of security mechanisms--
- Prevent attacks, detect attacks, recover from attacks
Prevention: cryptograpy and access control are often used
Detection: Intrusion detection systems are often used to detect attacks during or after the attack
Recovery: React to the attack, stop the attack in progress or allow it to continue
          Repair the damage

--Assumptions and trust--
- Security policies are always based on some assumptions about the behaviour of compntents and entities in the system
Two assupmtions:
- Secure and nonsecure states of the system
- guarantee that a system in the secure states will never become nonsecure
- If either fails - > system is insecure


--Assurance--

Attempts to quantify some of the assumtipons about trust in the security
Requires a specification of the behaviour of the system
  - Satisfy a specifaction if the specification correctly states how the system will function
Assurance considers all aspects of SD (software development)
  - Specifications must be correct and unambiguous
  - Design of the system translates the specification into compontents that will implement them
Stronger assurance requires formal proofs of correctness

--Operational issus--
Defender. cost of an effective attack must be higher than the design, implementation etc
Attacker: cost of an effective attack must be lower than the benefits gained through the attack

Risk analyses deterimnes what attacks are plausible and termines the cost of theese attacks(creditcard accepts small amounts of fraud)
Cost benefit analysis establish whether the benefits of a particular countermeasure exceeds the cost implementing and operating it
Laws and customs in local enviourment plays an important role
  - Different laws on data protection are defined in different juristdictions
  - Policies and mechanisms that are legal but unacceptable, in the local environment should have avoided


..Organisational Issues--
Implementing security in a large organsistion is difficult and tech is often the easy bit
 - Benefits of security are not directly visible on the bottom line
- Some security mechanisms may actually be costly (and slow down communication)
Responsability for computer security is not always obvious
 - IT: servers, hardware and software
Social Engineering (phishing) is surprisingly effective
Security incidents are not always attacks!
